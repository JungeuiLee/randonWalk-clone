# RandomWalk Copy

## Project Overview
- A multi-page e-commerce landing site built while self-studying frontend development on my own.
- Combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch to grasp how a basic web front structure ties together from header to main content to footer.
- Planned, designed, and implemented the interactions solo, which helped me understand page layout flows and styling decisions end to end.

## Key Features
- Top navigation layout with brand and category dropdown menus.
- Main hero carousel with auto-playing slides and indicator dots.
- Product grid on the home page plus standalone HTML pages for details, brands, and sales.
- `copy_RandomWalk.js` handles slide cloning, looping, and timing—hands-on practice with DOM scripting.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for the overall structure.
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, custom styling).
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling, autoplay logic).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or unzip the project locally.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser—no additional build steps required.

## Lessons Learned
- Broke down UI blocks like headers, carousels, and card grids into markup and layered CSS to understand how the layout comes together.
- Built an infinite carousel from scratch, learning about DOM events, cloned nodes, and transition management.
- Next goals include adding responsive behavior, binding real data, and covering accessibility checklists to keep leveling up my frontend skills.
